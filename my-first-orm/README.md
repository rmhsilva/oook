# My First ORM

So this started out cos I wanted.. A decent ruby-ish ORM thing. And I didn't
know about CLSQL.

So I started implementing a full blown SQL table model.

Obviously, a solution to this problem already exists, with *far* more work than
I could possibly bother putting into it.

So instead of starting from scratch, I shall use CLSQL and build a thin wrapper
on top of it to provide a bit of ruby-style magic. Because a little magic never
hurt anyone.
